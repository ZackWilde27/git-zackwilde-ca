		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<h3>Hi, my name is Talbot Grimes, but everyone just calls me The Blight. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated with how even the smallest of plants could have serious health effects from the positive to the negative, and dedicated my life to biochemisty. After contributing to science I have spent time studying the art of running very fast, but only in a straight line directly into a wall. These days I enjoy a nice nightly stroll in the woods where I sacrifice survivors to <em>The Entity</em> in a death game. Some people have told me that I should find a more normal hobby, like knitting, but I just can't see myself doing anything else.</h3>
		<p>I've been sacrificing survivors to the entity since 2020. Always in a rush, I'm a busy guy.</p>
		<div id="Achievements">

		<h3>My Story</h3>
		<p>My official backstory is quite long, so I wouldn't even be able to fit it on this page, but basically I used to be a scientist until I became addicted to the special serum</p>
