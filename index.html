					<p>Ever since I was a kid I've been fascinated with Computer Assisted Design. When I was just 8 year old I was writing stories in Microsoft Word, with dreams of becoming a writer. Nowadays my passion is electronic music and video games.</p>

					<p>My Game Philosophy</p>
					<p>I started game development mainly for one reason: When I've perfected my craft enough to ship games I am hoping to change the industry. The problem with modern video games is all the cool stuff we lost around the mid 2000s. Where did all the cheat codes go? Where did all the unintentionally explorable areas and fun glitches go? I loved the days of stacking unlimited C4 in a single spot so that the resulting explosion would propel the player out of bounds, or doing some good old fashioned parkour to reach somewhere that wasn't intended.</p>

					<p>My Music Style</p>
					<p>I am a huge fan of intense dubstep, and the way I'd describe my style is a rhythm-over-pattern approach. The call is always part of the established pattern but the response to the call usually isn't. It's possible to tell where in the drop a given section is, because of the uniqueness throughout.</p>

					<p>Other Achievements</p>
					<p>I am branching out as much as possible because I love seeing what's possible on my own systems. I installed Apache2 on my secondary laptop running Ubuntu and spent forever tweaking the configuration files until it worked because I love this stuff, and I want to see what's possible on my own server.</p>
